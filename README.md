physics and science virtual experiments.
Physics simulations written in javascript.
Each simulation is designed so that virtual experiments can be carried out
- an independent variable is changed, a dependent variable is measured.
Some simulations are based on physics formulas, 
but most are based on iterative principles from which the Physics formulas arise naturally
