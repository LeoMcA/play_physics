          Shows the position of the Sun and the Moon...
        <br>...any date ...any time ...any latitude (in Northern Hemisphere)
        <br>Age and phase of the Moon is given as well
        <br>
        <br>The sky is one colour, and that means only the illuminated portion of the moon is shown.
        <br>If you want a garduated sky choose the next sim...

      <p class="notes"><b></b>
          Like the above simulation...
        <br>...but with a graduated sky,
        <br>and so moon's unilluminated side is black rather than invisible.

      <p class="notes"><b></b>
          Like the first simulation...
        <br>...but with a large moon overlapped to show the phase in more detail.

                  This sim only shows the phase and age of the moon but not its position.
                  <br>Choose the date...
                <br>...choose the time of day.
                <br>...choose the date...
                <br>The Moon shows its phase and age
