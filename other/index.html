  <br>Choose your latitude (Northern Hemisphere)...
  <br>...and see the Sun's position  in the sky.
  <br> <i>- not 100% accurate, as everything (Earth's orbit, Earth's surface etc.) is assumed to be circular;
  <br> but sunrise and sunset times seem to be +- 15 mins - but, beware, times are not 'daylight-saving-time',
  <br> so you might need to add 1 hour to sunrise/set if in summer months and your country uses DST.</i></p>

          Like the above simulations...
        <br>but has position and age of the Moon as well
        <br>
        <br>The Moon does not yet show its phase (but it can be estimated from age)...
        <br>...that will come in a future version
        <br>For now, open in conjunction with the next sim...
