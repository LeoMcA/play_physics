<p class="notes"><b>Vectors:</b>
    This Sim allows you to plot 2 to 6 vectors, and to see the resultant when they are all added
  <br>The Sim can show the vectors joined top-to-tail or with a single origin
  <br>The Sim generates random vectors and each vector can be changed by the user.
  <br>The numerical value of each vector is given so you can practise vector addition (show resultant to check your answer)</p>

<p class="notes"><b>Moments:</b>
    This Sim presents a beam (of variable length) and the vertical forces on the beam.
  <br>The forces can be have their magnitude and distance changed by the user.
<br>The Sim can generate different types of random forces: 1)fully random; 2)total force = 0; 3)total moments = 0; or 4)full equilibrium.
<br>The numerical value of each force is given so it can be used to practise moments calculation.</p>

<p class="notes"><b>Thinking distance:</b>
  When the simulation starts the car is already moving. You click on the animation to apply the brakes.
  Your reaction time is measured. Different simulations are given that required greater levels of attention.</p>

<p class="link"><a href="mv/index.html">Momentum - 2 body interactions in 1D - click here</a>
<p class="notes"><b>Momentum:</b>
  A set of Sims that show either 2 body 'collisions' or 2 body 'explosions'.
  The bodies have variable mass and velocity, and the Sims
  calculate the final velocities and energies after the interactions.
<br>The elasticity of the collisions can be changed from 100% down to 0%.
<br>The energy of the explosions can be altered.</p>

<p class="notes"><b>SHM:</b>
  A Simulation of Driving oscillators, Forced frequencies and Resonance
<br>Readings can be taken from the simulation to draw a <i><b>frequence vs. amplitude</b></i> curve.
