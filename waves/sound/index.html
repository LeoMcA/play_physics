<h1 class="purple">Speed of Sound Experiments simulations:</h1>

<p class="link"><a href="speedSound v3.html">Using 2 microphones:</a>
<p class="notes"><b></b>
    Position 2 microphones, create a 'bang',
    and the time taken for the sound to travel between the microphones is recorded.
  Do it a number of times and you'll be able to plot
  a <i>distance vs. time</i> graph to find the speed of sound</p>

<p class="link"><a href="speedSound v1echoStdnt.html">Using 1 microphone and an echo</a>
  <p class="notes"><b></b>
    Position the distance between the microphones and the wall,
    create a 'bang',
    and the time taken for the sound to travel from the microphone
    to the wall, and back again, is recorded.
  Do it a number of times and you'll be able to plot
  a <i>distance vs. time</i> graph
  (either distance or time will need recalculating...) to find the speed of sound</p>
<p class="link"><a href="speedSound v1echoALL.html">Using 1 microphone and an echo - quick version</a>
  <p class="notes"><b></b>
    The same Sim as the previous one but this one gives an instant read-out of the calculated speed
    using the measured data.</p>
