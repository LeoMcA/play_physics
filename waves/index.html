<p class="notes"><b>Reflection:</b>
    These Sims are all showing a ray of light reflecting off a mirror,
    showing the angles involved, and the locations of the object and image
  <br>The Law of Reflection is almost trivial - so experiments to measure angles can
  be rather anti-climactic...
  <br>These Sims include projected numbers which offer a range of unpredictable experiments which create
  unpredictable, yet continuous graphs.
  <br>Also a variant Sim is offered that measures the time taken by the light to travel,
  so showing how the Law of Reflection arises from Fermat's principle - the principle of least time</p>
