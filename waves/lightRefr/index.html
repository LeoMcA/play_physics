<p class="link"><a href="lightRefr_v5.html">The Refraction of Light</a>
<p class="notes"><b></b>
    Alter the refractive index of the 2 media.
  <br>Alter the angle of incidence.
<br>The simulation displays the angle of refraction.</p>

<p class="notes"><b></b>
    While the 1st Sim (above) can show Total Internal Reflection,
    this Sim is explicitly meant for showing TIR using a semicircular block
    as might be shown in the school lab.</p>

  <p class="notes"><b></b>
    User can change the start and end point of the light ray, and where the ray passes thru'
  the boundary between the 2 media.
<br>The simulation displays the distance travelled, and the time taken,
by the light on the chosen path.
<br>Which path has the shortest distance? Which path has the smallest time?
What are the angles of those paths?
