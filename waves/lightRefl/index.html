<h1 class="purple">Reflection of Light simulations:</h1>

<p class="notes"><b>Reflection:</b>
    These Sims are all showing a ray of light reflecting off a mirror,
    showing the angles involved.</p>

<p class="link"><a href="lightRefl_v25projNosv2.html">The Law of Reflection</a>
  <p class="notes"><b></b>
    The Law of Reflection is almost trivial - so experiments to measure angles can
    be rather anti-climactic...
    <br>This Sim includes projected numbers which offer a range of unpredictable experiments which create
    unpredictable, yet continuous graphs.</p>
<p class="link"><a href="lightRefl_v25objNimgv2.html">Reflection and Image creation</a>
  <p class="notes"><b></b>
    This Sim shows the construction and location of the Image as well as the Object.</p>
<p class="link"><a href="lightRefl_TimeLineALL.html">Fermat's Principle</a>
  <p class="notes"><b></b>
    A variant Sim is offered that measures the distance taken by the light as it travels to the mirror and back.
    So showing how the Law of Reflection arises from Fermat's principle
     - the principle of least time - but here given as a 'principle of least distance',
     as all the speeds are the same (in the Refraction Sims the <u>time</u> of travel will be measured
     but 'least distance' is easier to understand to start with)
     (To find the 'times' divide all distances by 'c').</p>
